# oec2019
Code for the 2019 Ontario Engineering Competition programming challenge.  
All teams were given 6 hours to complete the competition.

### Problem Statement
We were tasked with the need to reduce hospital wait times. Our solution was to create an application that uses a machine learning to calculate triage scores and efficiently queue patients in a priority queue.

### Running the code
Run main.py for the machine learning and console program.  
Run sim.py for the simulation and bed allocation algorithm, including performance metrics.

Team members: Christopher Agia, Steve Kim, Samuel Looper, Luke Volpatti
